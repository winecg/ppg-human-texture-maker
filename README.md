# People Playground Human Texture Maker

I made this program to make the process of creating a human texture mod for the game People Playground faster and easier.
This program will create a folder for your mod and download the human textures for you to edit, a script.cs file, and a mod.json file.

The three steps to making the mod can be completed in any order. 

When you create the mod folder and download the textures, the textures will be inside the folder. This program won't be able to edit the images for you, so you will 
have to edit them yourself using an image editor.

The C# and JSON files will not be added to the folder automatically, so you will need to move them there yourself. Also, if you want to change something in the C# and 
JSON files, you can edit them using a text editor. For both the C# and JSON makers, the program will ask you for filenames for the thumbnail images. The C# thumbnail will be the in-game icon that you click to select an item to spawn. The JSON thumbnail will be the image for your mod on its Steam Workshop page. These files don't need to exist at the time of making the mod, but you will need to add files with the same names as the ones you specified in the C# and JSON files before you use your mod.

Once you're done you can move your folder to the Mods folder in your People Playground local files. When you start the game, it will compile the folder you added and you 
will be able to use your mod.
